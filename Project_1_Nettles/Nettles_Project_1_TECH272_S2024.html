<h1>Deane Nettles</h1>
<p>I was born in New England, raised in Ohio, and have lived in the DC/Baltimore area for all but two years of my life since middle school. I learned graphic design on the student newspaper at NVCC and followed it with a 40 year career in graphic design.</p>
<p>Currently I am married and living in Baltimore. I teach graphic design at various <strong>collages and universities</strong> in the area, and am particularly proud that I am teaching upper-division classes in advertising and branding. I also work with individual clients.</p>
<p>In ten years, I hope to be retired and have <em>visited Italy</em> with my wife. I also hope to do more sculpting and painting.</p>

<h2>Design Studios</h2>
<p>The first studio I worked in was Morgan Burchette in Alexandria. My friend Regina, who I knew from the student paper, had a job there, and suggested they hire me.</p>
